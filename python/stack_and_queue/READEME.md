# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue .

## Node
### Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
## Stack
### Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
## Queue
### Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
