# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

### 1. add
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
### 2. get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
### 3. contains
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
### 4. hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### functionality:

- [x] Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
- [x] Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
- [x] Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
- [x] Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
- [x] Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
- [x] Successfully hash a key to an in-range value
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
###  Big O space==========> space complexity of O(n)
### time ===========> time complexity of O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
### The method publicly available in each of your hashtable
1. add
2. get
3. contains
4. hash
