# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- [x]  Node : Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. done
- [x] Create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- [x] pre order. Done
- [x] in order. Done
- [x] post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Done
- [x] Create a  Binary Search Tree  that have  the following additional methods:
- [x]  Add that have arguments: value and return: nothing
### Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- [x]  Contains that take Argument: value and returns: boolean
### indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge was when work with  add method in binary tree
the task take 2 hrs to complete
