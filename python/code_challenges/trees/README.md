# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- [x]  Node : Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. done
- [x] Create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- [x] pre order. Done
- [x] in order. Done
- [x] post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Done
- [x] Create a  Binary Search Tree  that have  the following additional methods:
- [x]  Add that have arguments: value and return: nothing
### Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- [x]  Contains that take Argument: value and returns: boolean
### indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge was when work with  add method in binary tree
the task take 2 hrs to complete
## Approach & Efficiency --IN Tree
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
## The time  O(n) and  Space  O(1)  for tree
##  for find the max number in tree


### The method used in binary search tree

1. Add
2. Contains

### The method used in Binary tree--IN Tree
1. pre order
2. post order
3. In order

# =====Code Challenge: Class 16 -- date 2021-10-31=====
# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
## Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.



## Whiteboard Process--IN Max value In Tree

## Approach & Efficiency--IN Max value In Tree
## space O(1)
## time O(n)

### taking 3 hrs to done the work
