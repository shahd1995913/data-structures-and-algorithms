## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
## Time and space complextity :
## Time -->O(n)
## Spac -->O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
## I make test for function and it work corretly
