## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

# Time Complexity : O(n)
# Space Complexity :O(1)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

## I am traceing the final output and the result it work correctly
