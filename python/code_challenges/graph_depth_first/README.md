# Depth First Traversal
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## create a function that called a Depth first that take a Arguments: Node (Starting point of search) and Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## create a function that take a start node (node to  search) and the output will be path in DFS logic   it will be  a list of node.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Time complexity : O(n)
## Space complexity : O(1)
